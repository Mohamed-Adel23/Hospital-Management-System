# Hospital Management System (CareCoord)
## Description
The biggest problem facing health care centres remains today. Technical problems. There is a rare health care centre that works with a modern and organised technical system that helps it organise the schedule, payment methods, save patient data, and communicate. So we were keen to find a solution to this problem, Through a Website that contains pages for the patient that enables him to record his data, book an appointment to visit the doctor, describe the pain, and view the doctor's data, pages for the nurse that enables her to confirm the patient's reservation and conduct medical tests, and pages for the doctor that enables him to view the patient's data, write his prescription, and show the medical history for the patient and pages for admin to control the whole system.

## Why Carecoord ?
CareCoord is designed to enhance care coordination among all the participants concerned with a patient’s care, ensuring that the patient’s needs and preferences are known and communicated at the right time to the right people. Whether you are a hospital administrator, a physician, a nurse, or a social worker, Carecoord can help you deliver better care with less hassle.
